PWA Icon Requirements
====================

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create the following icons:

1. icon-192x192.png
   - Size: 192x192 pixels
   - Purpose: maskable (safe area for different shapes)
   - Use: Android home screen, splash screens

2. icon-512x512.png
   - Size: 512x512 pixels
   - Purpose: any (standard square icon)
   - Use: PWA install prompts, splash screens

Icon Design Guidelines:
- Use your app logo/branding
- Ensure good contrast
- For maskable icons, keep important content within a safe zone (80% of the icon)
- Save as PNG with transparency if needed
- Optimize file size (use tools like TinyPNG)

Place these files in the /public directory.
